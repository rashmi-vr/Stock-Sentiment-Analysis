# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis

A stock sentiment analysis program that attempts to predict the movements of stocks based on the prevailing sentiment from social media websites (twitter, reddit and stocktwits).
Each Tweet will be given a bullish, neutral, or bearish sentiment. Every Tweet's sentiment within a certain time period will be averaged to give the stocks total sentiment for that time period.
